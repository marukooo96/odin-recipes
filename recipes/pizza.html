           <h2>Description</h2>
           <p>Inspired by the pizza at Bar Del Corso, this Pizza Margherita features tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, with just a hint of sea salt.</p>

           <h2>Ingredients</h2>
           <ul>
                <li>3 1/3 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup flour for dusting</li>
                <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
                <li>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>20 leaves fresh basil</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
           </ul>

           <h2>Steps</h2>
           <ol>
                <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Mix water, yeast and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir half the flour mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. WHen dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Lighlty oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise ina warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
                <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
           </ol>
